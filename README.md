Scoreboard Stopwatch
============
### Introduction
This is a simple **scoreboard stopwatch** that was made using HTML, CSS and jQuery. The numbers are made of 15 blocks placed in a specific order. The maximum time is 99 minutes 59 seconds. After the maximum time is reached, the stopwatch starts from zero.

### Controls
The stopwatch can be stopped/started by pressing **SPACE** and reset by pressing **0**

### Customization
Using _config/config.js_ file you can customize:
1. Numbers' color
2. Background color
3. Stopwatch resetting options

### Fun fact
If you run the stopwatch for 2.8 million years, it will reach the maximum safe integer value and crash. :)
